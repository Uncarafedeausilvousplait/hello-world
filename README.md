# hello-world
Following the tutorial. Hello, world!
"Write a bit about yourself:"
"I'm just a dude, playing a dude, disguised as a dude.
"That's from Tropic Thunder!" you say. "That's not original!"
My brother in Christ, I'm following a tutorial so I can maybe understand github. None of this is original.
